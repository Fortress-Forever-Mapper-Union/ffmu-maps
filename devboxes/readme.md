# devboxes

This directory is meant to store barebones devtexture layout "sketches", what some prefer to call greyboxes.
Maps in this directory should serve as baseplates for further rework/expansion and detailing, or proofs of concepts for layouts.

Please do not commit anything else under this directory, and 'fork' the maps to their own directories if you make something more advanced out of them.
